# NUC-SITE

This repository contains the front-end for Study Space NU.

## Running the app.

To run the app, run the command `npm start` (this in turn runs `react-scripts start`). Then you can check out the site on `localhost:3000`. 

### NB: If you do not have the database running locally then no classrooms will be displayed. In order to fix, you can clone the repo and run locally [INSERT LINK]. In the future, there may be a sample dataset created that is attached to this repository that enables work on the front-end without requiring a DB connection.

## Testing the app.

To run tests, run the command `npm test`. 

## Contributing.
